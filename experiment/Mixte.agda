Note: there is some hope to extract from the result of the mixte logical relation some results
about the purely nominal one and the purely de Brujin one. However the results obtain about the
de Brujin relation may be reduced a bit. Indeed when a shadowing occurs on the nominal side, a
de Bruijn index is removed from the relation.
